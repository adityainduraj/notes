- Variant of two pointers approach, moving 2 pointers at different speeds
- Start by placing both slow and fast pointers at the head of a linked list. 
- Move the slow pointer **one** node at a time and the fast pointer **two** nodes at a time. 
- If there is a cycle, the two pointers will eventually meet
- This technique can also find the middle node of a linked list **in one pass**. When the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be at the middle.
