- Preorder, Postorder, Inorder and Level Order
- LOT is useful for level by level traversal starting from the root node, usually implemented using queue
- Goal is to identify which traversal will be best for the given situation. 
	- To retrieve the values of a binary search tree in sorted order - INORDER
	- To create a copy of a tree (serialization) - PREORDER
	- When you want to process child nodes before the parent, like in deletion - POSTORDER
	- When you need to explore all nodes at current level before moving on to the next - LOT
