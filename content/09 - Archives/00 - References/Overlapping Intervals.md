- Intervals or ranges that may overlap
- Merging intervals - merge all overlapping intervals into 1
- Interval intersection - find the intersection between two groups of intervals
- Insert interval - insert an interval into a group of intervals
- Problems like - *Finding a minimum number of meeting rooms for meetings with overlapping times*
- Example - Merging Intervals
	- First you sort the list of intervals by start time
	- Then check if it overlaps with next interval (if start time of second is less than end time of first)
	- If it overlaps, choose start of first and end of second as interval and add to empty list of intervals. 
	- If it doesn't overlap, add it normally. 
	- You will end up with a list of merged intervals.
