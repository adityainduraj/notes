## Notes:
In the TED Talk titled "How to Speak So That People Want to Listen," Julian Treasure explores the power of the human voice and offers practical advice on how to communicate effectively. He begins by emphasizing that the human voice is one of the most powerful tools we possess, capable of starting wars or expressing love. However, many people experience the frustration of speaking without being heard, prompting the need for strategies to enhance communication.

Treasure identifies **seven deadly sins of speaking** that hinder effective communication:

1. **Gossip** - Speaking ill of someone who is not present.
2. **Criticism** - Offering negative feedback that makes others defensive.
3. **Negativity** - A pessimistic attitude that is difficult for others to engage with.
4. **Complaining** - A common habit that spreads negativity and does not foster positivity.
5. **Excuses** - Blaming others and not taking responsibility for one's actions.
6. **Exaggeration** - Overstating facts, which can lead to mistrust.
7. **Dogmatism** - Confusing opinions with facts, making conversations unproductive.

To counter these negative habits, Treasure introduces the **"HAIL" framework**, which stands for:

- **H**onesty: Being truthful in communication.
- **A**uthenticity: Being genuine and true to oneself.
- **I**ntegrity: Keeping promises and being reliable.
- **L**ove: Wishing well for others, which softens honesty and criticism.

Treasure also discusses various vocal techniques to improve speaking, such as:

- **Register**: Using a deeper voice can convey authority and strength.
- **Timbre**: A warm and rich voice is more pleasant to listen to.
- **Prosody**: Varying pitch and tone adds meaning to speech.
- **Tempo**: Adjusting speed can emphasize points and maintain interest.
- **Silence**: Strategic pauses can enhance the impact of spoken words.

He shares six vocal warm-up exercises to prepare for speaking engagements, such as deep breathing and tongue exercises, which help to enhance vocal quality and presence.

In conclusion, Treasure envisions a world where people speak with intention and listen consciously, creating environments conducive to understanding and connection. He encourages the audience to consider the impact of their words and the importance of fostering a culture of effective communication [1, {ts:0}].
